I'm working through Richard McElreaths Statistical Rethinking, 2nd edition.

I try to be pretty thorough (as to actually learn something), doing the exercises (in `exercises`), translating the R code in the book (in `scripts`), and writing some of the tools the R package `rethinking` provides (in `src`).

From here I'll try to improve the existing `StatisticalRethinking.jl` and `TuringModels.jl` packages.

I mostly made this repository for my own benefit but I'm glad if you find it useful and are happy for any issues raised.
