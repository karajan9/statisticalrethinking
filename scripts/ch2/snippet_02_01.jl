With Distributions.jl working with distributions is a little different that with R. Instead of having `rbinom`, `dbinom` and `pbinom` we just got the `Binomial` distribution which we can work with.
d = Binomial(9, 0.5)
rand(d)     # singe random draw
rand(d, 10) # 10 random draws
pdf(d, 6)   # probability of getting 6
cdf(d, 6)   # cumulative probability of getting 6
Take a look at Distributions.jl docs to see what else you can do with distributions. https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/latest/index.html

This is the next difference from Julia to R. You don't have automatic broadcasting (making functions work the same whether you run it on a single number or on an array of numbers). However, fixing this is very easy, you only have to annotate your function call with a dot: `f(single_number)` -> `f.(array_of_numbers)`.
That means the translation of the line `likelihood = pdf.(Binomial.(9, p_grid), 6)` goes something like: first, for every value in `p_grid` make a binomial distribution with that p value. For every distribution then take the pdf of 6. The same in the next line, this is elementwise multiplication.

Related advide: when you get an error of the kind "no method matching ...(::Float64, ::Array{Float64})" or similar, first check if all your dots are in order.
